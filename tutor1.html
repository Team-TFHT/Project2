    <h1> A (very) rough tutorial on how to square-knot a belt </h1>
    <p> If you know me, you'll know that I'm no photographer!  Still, in honour of a request I
      received from the Head Knothead of Knotheads Worldwide, I have made the following tutorial
      on how to completely muck up a square-knotted belt. 
    </p>
    <h2> AN EXCELLENT SOURCE FOR MATERIALS IS MARTIN COMBS </h2>

    <p>Tip: #24 line used below, for which 16 lines gives appx 1-3/8" width belt.  Smaller line will 
      permit more sets across for the same width. 1-1/2" is about max normal width!
    </p>
    <h2> initial setup:</h2>
    <p> My workbench currently is a hard-maple TV Table to which I
      have screwed a crossbar (scrap maple deck stanchion end)
      using a three inch wood screw and four washers between the
      table itself and the bar to provide spacing for the skewers
      which provide stability for the work.  I also "clamp" the work
      with another skewer which goes across the work and under the
      lashings shewn to the left and right of the work in the picture.'
      (The bucket holds ten pounds of "Sackrete" concrete mix
      which keeps the table from tipping over onto me... you can use
      that, dirt, water (not recommended) or a large cat, as you
      prefer.      (Pic. #0)
      To begin a belt (for real), one would larks-head the number of
      lines to be used around the fixed end of the buckle,  being sure
      that the tongue is in the proper position and that the larks
      heads are all facing up.  Here I have done this direct to a
      skewer, since this is only a demonstration belt and have lashed
      that on top of a piece of cardboard to provide a focal plane as
      well as a bit of contrast for the pictures. (see below: Pic. #1)
      Here also I show my "belly-hook" which is a piece of bamboo
      (from a toast-grabber! If you carefully separate the legs of the
      toast-puller you can get two legs! Such a deal!) to which has
      been lashed and glued a  5" piece of round chopstick.  By
      making up the standing parts of the knots as though the
      belly-hook were a dock bitt, you can hold up to six pair of lines
      at a time.
    </p>

    <P> Tip: Clean your hands often, especially when using
      white material, and clean your area often as well... dust
      gets into the lay of the lines and dirty is quite apparent
      on these belts.
      Note: Most belters will work in a standing position with
      the work level with their eyes and a long drop at their
      feet.  I prefer to sit down, (1) because I'm old and lazy,
      (2) because my back hurts and (3) quite enough
      Irishmen have stood at the edge of a "long drop", thank
      you very much, indeed!

    <h2> line setup: </h2>
    <p>(Pic. #2)  Shows the larks-heading of the lines onto the skewer
      preparatory to the debac...  I mean, starting the belt.
      For a larks-head direct to the beltbuckle attachment, measure
      EIGHT TIMES the desired length and then middle it and put the
      larks-head directly to the buckle's attachment point! Be sure the
      larks-heads are all made the same way!
      If you are making up the belt and will be adding the buckle
      later on,  measure EIGHT TIMES, middle it and then do the larks-
      heads around a skewer.   Do the simple square knotting until
      you have about three inches and then consider THAT POINT to
      your beginning... This allows enough "fabric" to fold over and sew
      to the belt's back to hold the buckle.
      Note that this is a good measurement for all belts which do
      NOT utilize "Chevrons" and "Diamonds"... For those, you should
      measure NINE to TEN times the finished length, depending on
      how many Diamonds or Chevrons you'll be putting in.
      (It's MUCH better to waste some material than to come 
      up short!)
    </p>
    <img src="media/belt001.jpg" alt="belt01">
    <p>To start the belt,  take ALL the lines in
      your RIGHT hand and drop the FIRST on the LEFT,
      then hold the next two and drop the FOURTH and
      FIFTH, HOLD the next two, DROP the next two and
      so on, until you've reached the other side.
      TERMINOLOGY:  Of any given set of four
      lines, the OUTBOARD two are the  working
      lines while the INBOARD pair are the
      "filler" or "standing" lines.
      Smooth all the lines from the gripe toward your
      belly and make them all up (as flat as possible) on
      your bellyhook, just like you were making up to the
      pier.  (See Pic 1 and linked instructions.) You want
      to get an equal (or nearly so) tension on all lines.
    </p>

    <p>Right.
      Now, there are those who say the only way to make a squareknot is to take the two
      lines and do the "Right Over Left and ... Ahhh ... Err ..." method, but I use the
      "Loop And Pull" method, which is much faster.     Also, I don't get so confused by
      all those "Lefts", "Rights", "Unders" and all that lot.    (For picture clarity, 
      and to preserve your (putative) sanity, I am only showing ONE set of filler cords!)
    </p>
    <img src="media/belt003.jpg" alt="belt03">
    <p>Follow the bouncing instructions:
      Take the line FOUR and make a loop UNDER lines
      TWO and THREE as shewn in (Pic. #3).
    </p>
    <img src="media/belt004.jpg" alt="belt04">
    <p>Push the standing parts of Line Four (see the right
      hand above in PIC. #4)  up around lines Two and
      Three and pull them through the bight you formed
      with the LEFT hand.  This should look like (Pic.
      #4).    (If you don't get this part right, just stop and
      work at it until you do...)   (Thank you, Uncle Doug!)
    </p>
    <img src="media/belt005.jpg" alt="belt05">
    <p>Now, take Line ONE and pull it THROUGH the
      double bight formed when you complete6d the step
      above.   Pull it completely through at this time
      (Pic. #5).
    </p>
    <img src="media/belt006.jpg" alt="belt06">
    <p>(Pic. #6)  shews what you now should have
      after going through the previous gyrations.  
    </p>
    <img src="media/belt007.jpg" alt="belt07">
    <p>SNUG up the top part of the knot to the
      larkshead, (Pic. #7) then...
    </p>
    <img src="media/belt008.jpg" alt="belt08"> 
    <p>SNUG up the bottom part       (Pic. #8) and
      you've got the first of the many, many knots
      required to build the belt.  
      ( NOTE:  We're not trying to strangle Aunt
      Matilda here, so don't REEEEELY tighten the
      knots up,  just get 'em nice and snug.)
      TIP:  If you DO overtighten you'll have uneven
      rows and sloppy-looking knots.
